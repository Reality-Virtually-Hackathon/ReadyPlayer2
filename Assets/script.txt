HAN: Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon
HAN:Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
BEN: Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.
HAN: Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
BEN: Should I have?
HAN: It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
HAN: I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
HAN: I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo?
BEN: Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
HAN: What is it? Some kind of local trouble?
BEN: Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
HAN: Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance.
LUKE: Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!
HAN: But who's going to fly it, kid! You?
LUKE: You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen… 
BEN: We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
HAN: Seventeen, huh!
HAN: Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready.Docking bay Ninety-four.
BEN: Ninety-four.
HAN:Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
